/**
 * Classes that derive from this type act as stack-allocated wrappers arround a shader graph expression and define the
 * output type of said operation. Classes of this type are widely used as inputs to functions that build up new shader
 * graph expressions. For example, the ´float32´ struct is a proxy for a 32-bit floating-point value that is created by
 * a shader graph expression. The object itself does not hold the actual value but stores a pointer to the shader graph
 * node from which it was calculated. The user is only required to interact with the stack-allocated Value objects and
 * function calls to build the shader graph. The creation and storage of the actual ShaderGraph is abstracted away via
 * this level of indirection.
